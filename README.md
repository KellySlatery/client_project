## Problem Statement

For our fifth project in General Assembly Data Science Immersive course, we tackled optimizng 

- lots of maps out there for traffic, use user input and satellite (?)
- don't work so well during disasters
- information during disasters often comes in the form of: instant social media updates (Twitter)
- many official accounts

- as the state that gets hit by the widest variety and one of the largest plethora of natural disasters, we chose to focus on Texas
- Puerto Rico if we had had more time to account for Spanish language resources
- In 2017, Texas saw one of the most ___ disasters in its history--Hurricane Harvey
- for the purposes of this project, we narrowed our scope to looking at live Twitter data from official accounts (DOT, police, ...?) to identify up-to-date road condition and other travel information

- created vigorous models with ___ accuracy to determine which tweets contained relevant information, and additionally which tweets contained coordinates or an otherwise usable location reference (such as an address, intersection, or direction/exit on a highway)
- process

- from here, we could use geo.py to find coordinates of location references
- then use an interface such as the Here.com API or Google Maps API to plot road conditions in real-time
- data files would be compiled into scripts that would automatically search twitter for relevant data (specific location & search query terms) whenever a user entered their location, and would reload a map locating any relevant information in real-time
- last step would be to use an algorithm like ______ to plot evacuation routes, utilizing mapping attributes/methods of the API

- Our model allows us to utilize the vast resource of Twitter data in the event of a disaster when our usual technologies fail us
- This is the bridge that was missing in getting information to people in the most accessible, quick-to-use, easy-tounderstand form in the case of emergencies
- we hope it can be put into practice someday!!
